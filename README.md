# Python Challenge 1: Food Truck Ordering System

## Overview
The second project for Columbia University's AI Bootcamp is to create an interactive ordering system for a food truck. With Python, this program gives users the ability to chose food items from a menu, decide what quantities they would liek to order and then, once ordered generate a receipt for the items aquired.

## Features
- Interactive menu display.
- Ability to imput menu items and select quantity.
- Validate input for food item and quantity.
- Generate order summary and display total price.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash

```

## Usage
To run the program, navigate to the cloned directory and execute:
```bash
python menu.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to place your order.

## How It Works
- The program starts by displaying a menu to the user.
- Users select items by entering corresponding menu numbers.
- Input validation is implemented to ensure valid selections.
- After each selection, users are prompted to enter the quantity.
- The program supports continuous ordering until the user decides to finish.
- Finally, a receipt is generated, displaying each item, quantity, and the total cost.
